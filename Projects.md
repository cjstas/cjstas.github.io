# Projects
## Capstone Project 
### Accutech Systems Trust Admin App
This project is a mobile application for Android and iOS made for Accutech Systems, a wealth management firm. The application is intended for administrators only and allows them to perform basic tasks on the go without having to log in to the desktop version, which is difficult on a mobile device. To retrieve the necessary information, it makes requests through Cheetah, which is an internal Accutech API. The application itself was built using the Xamarin mobile platform, which uses C# and .NET technologies as the programming language and framework, respectively.

## Data Mining Projects
These projects are smaller in nature, and as such I do not have them publically provided on Github. If you wish to see any of these programs in action, feel free to reach out to me.
### K Means Clustering
Using python, I wrote and analyzed sets of data to cluster points using [K Means Clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering).
### K Nearest Neighbors
Using python, I wrote and analyzed specifically the [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) to come to standard results with the K Nearest Neighbors methodology.
### Market Basked Analysis
Using python, I wrote a program to discover associations between purchases within market data. This type of algorithm is used to discover associations between consumer products and advertise based on given information.
