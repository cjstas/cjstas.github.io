# Overview
Hello, I am Christopher Staszewski. I currently am a student attending Ball State University for a Major in Computer Science. I am living in Muncie (IN) with the intent to move to South Bend (IN) shortly after graduation. I have expertise in Software Development, and a strong basis in Data Science. Some basic overview of the types of projects I have worked on in the past include mobile applications through [Xamarin](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/xamarin) and Data Manipulation using a variety of datasets, including the UCI [Iris](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris) dataset.
